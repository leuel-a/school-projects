# Computer Graphics -- Assignment

One of the most exciting things you can do on a graphics computer is draw pictures that move. Whether you’re an engineer trying to see all sides of a mechanical part you’re designing, a pilot learning to fly an airplane using a simulation, or merely a computer-game aficionado, it’s clear that animation is an important part of computer graphics.


The main objective of this assignment is to create a simple animation using openGL that passes some kind of message or information to user or entertain. You can produce any type of animated object but it should be done using OpenGL API.
Note:
- All members of the group shown above should actively involve in the assignment
